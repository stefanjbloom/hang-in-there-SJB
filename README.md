# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
    I built a webpage that displays motivational posters.  These can be either user-created or randomized.  There are images, quotes, titles and even Un-Motivational Posters built-in to choose from. A user can provide a URL to another image source if they'd like to go that route. 

    The problem solved by this app is if someone needed to create a, for example, office motivational poster but did not have the technical skills or means to have one generated and compiled based off of their input.  By using this project, one can create a poster, then export, print and frame it for real-world decorative uses.

### Installation Instructions:
    On Github, fork this repo, then clone it down onto your local system(git clone ${whatever the SSH code is}).Then, either open this repo in your text editor and run `open index.html` OR navigate to the HANG-IN-THERE folder and open the index.html file.

### Context:
    This project took me about 6 days of work to complete.  I am 1 and a half weeks into Mod 2 of my Turing education.

### Learning Goals:
    The learning goals of this project was gaining familiarity with Javascript, HTML and CSS.  Learning about eventListeners, functions and querySelectors in JS were integral.  Time management and experiencing how HTML, JS and CSS work together was also incredibly valuable.  The tech used in this project was Github, MDN docs and ChatGPT.

### Wins + Challenges:
    A few wins from this project was having a breakthrough in understanding of CSS by referencing docs as well as getting assistance from cohort-mates and mentors.  Another win was the feeling of getting into a solid eventListener workflow and understanding.  The last, but not least, win was when I realized that much of what I struggled to learn in Ruby was analogous to what I wanted to do here on this project.

    Some challenges I faced was not getting much work done on this assignment over the weekend and struggling to catch up.  Creating objects in functions was also a bit of a challenge to me.  However the thing that stands out to me primarily is constructing the cleanData and displayUnmotivaationalPosters functions. Those two took me over a day to wrap my brain around.
